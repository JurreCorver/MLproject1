Notes
1. Better to extract the statistical feature from the intensity of the MRI directly rather than from the normalized intensity of MRI;

Documentation
1.Dataset name
format: 'cluster_#_train_org.csv'//'cluster_#_test_org.csv'
-org indicates that there is no transformation to the MRI intensity values
-# stands for the number of cluster used in k++ means clustering method
-train/test indicates training and test set repectively


2.Data description
- each column is a data point;
- there are six statistical features: mean, variance, standard variance, median, skewness, and kurtosis.
- the last row the age value

3. feature extraction process
-parameters
-number of cluster
-input: intensity of MRI (in a column vector)
-ouput: the features and the label (only the train data has the label)

steps:
(1) clustering the MRI to the given number clusters using K++ means;
(2) compute the statistical feature for each cluster
(3) write the output into a csv file
